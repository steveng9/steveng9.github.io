      "I am a lifelong student of mathematics and computer science who has trekked through various professional terrains. Having dedicated time at the Boeing Company as a software engineer, where I worked on the flight simulator, I'm now embedded in the PhD program at the University of Washington Tacoma, where I study under the guidance of Dr. Martine De Cock. Here, I served as the lead of a team that successfully captured 1st place in the SNAKE challenge focused on privacy attacks against synthetic data. Additionally, I am among the first cohort of NSF CSGrad4US fellows, and I have been honored as the recipient of the SET Outstanding Graduate Research Award (2023) and two Andrew and Julie Fry Innovation Awards (2023, 2025) for my contributions to the solution through which my research team secured 2nd place in the NSF-hosted U.S.-U.K. PETs Prize Challenge." +

      "My research interests gravitate toward privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML) and fair AI, which I consider critical fields that grapple with the widespread concerns surrounding the secure and equitable handling of personal data. Within this domain, I am particularly drawn to differential privacy and the privacy implications of graphical models, including graph neural networks, where the intersection of network topology and privacy guarantees presents fascinating theoretical and practical challenges. I perceive research in PPML as my avenue for contributing meaningfully toward technologies that exert tremendous impacts on people's lives. At the same time, working in academia will allow me to fuel my passion for helping and mentoring my fellow computer science students."
    
    // OLD: Steven is a lifelong student of mathematics and computer science. Having spent time at the Boeing Company as a software engineer, working on the flight simulator, he is now in the PhD program at the University of Washington Tacoma, studying with Martine De Cock. There, he was the lead of a team that won 1st place in the SNAKE challenge on privacy attacks against synthetic data. He is also the recipient of the SET Outstanding Graduate Research Award (2023) and the Andrew and Julie Fry Innovation Award (2023) for his contributions to the solution with which his research team won 2nd place in the NSF-hosted U.S.-U.K. PETs Prize Challenge 2023. His research interest is in privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML) and fair AI, critical fields that address the widespread concerns of handling personal data securely and equitably. Steven sees research in PPML as a way to contribute meaningfully toward technologies that have huge impacts in people's life. At the same time, working in academia will allow him to fuel his passion for helping and mentoring his fellow computer science students.
